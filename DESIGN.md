# Design

## Packages

`open-tuya` is the package most callers install: it bundles the others behind
`createTuyaClient`. Each part it bundles is its own package under the
`@open-tuya` scope:

- `@open-tuya/local` lets a caller who wants no cloud install no cloud code.
- `@open-tuya/cloud-developer` and `@open-tuya/cloud-app` each release when
  Tuya changes its API, which happens more often than the LAN protocol
  changes. [Cloud logins](#cloud-logins) says why they are two packages.
- `@open-tuya/devices` releases each time a device is added.
- `@open-tuya/simulators` is installed only as a dev dependency.
- `@open-tuya/core` holds the types and errors the others all use, so none of
  them depends on another.

`open-tuya` depends on the others through `^` ranges, so a minor or patch
release of one reaches its callers without a release of `open-tuya`.

Separate packages make the layers a dependency rule: pnpm links a package only
to what it lists, so `@open-tuya/local` cannot import a cloud package.

Rejected: one `open-tuya` package with subpath exports, and one with the
catalog split out. Either way, `local` importing the cloud code is held back
only by a rule in `AGENTS.md`, and a caller who wants no cloud code still
installs it.

## Simulators

`@open-tuya/simulators` depends on `@open-tuya/core` alone, and writes its
framing and encryption itself. A test of `@open-tuya/local` against a simulator
then runs two implementations against each other, and a bug in either fails
it. A simulator built on `@open-tuya/local` would share its bugs and pass.

## Cloud logins

Each way of signing in to the Tuya cloud is its own package:

| Package | Signs in | Trade-off |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@open-tuya/cloud-developer` | With a Tuya developer project's access ID and secret | The documented API, but the caller has to create a project, and its free trial lapses |
| `@open-tuya/cloud-app` | By scanning a QR code with the Smart Life app | No developer project, and the way tuya-local signs in, but the API is undocumented |

They are two packages because they are two APIs, on different hosts with
different request signing and tokens, and share no wire code. The types they
share are in `@open-tuya/core`, which defines the one cloud interface both
implement, so `open-tuya` falls back to whichever the caller set up. A caller
uses one of them, and the undocumented one can be fixed and released alone.

Rejected: one cloud package with both logins. A caller would install the
code of the login they do not use, and a fix to one would release both.

## Protocol versions

`@open-tuya/local` speaks 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 first. 3.4 and 3.5 negotiate a
session key, which is the hard part to get right. 3.1 comes after them, as
it is found only on old devices.

## Catalog

`@open-tuya/devices` is converted from tuya-local's device files by
`scripts/`, and the script runs again each time tuya-local adds devices. A new
device goes to tuya-local, so the two projects share one catalog rather than
splitting their contributors.

Each entry is a TypeScript file, `export default { … } satisfies
TuyaDeviceEntry`, so `tsc` checks every entry against the type:

- Rejected: tuya-local's YAML as it is. It describes a device as Home
  Assistant entities, and nothing checks a YAML file against our types.
- Rejected: JSON. TypeScript widens a JSON string to `string`, so `tsc` cannot
  catch a wrong value such as an unknown mode.

A device whose product has no entry could later be named by Tuya's standard
data point codes for its category, such as `temp_set`; the cloud reports each
device's codes.

## Releases

Changesets versions and publishes the packages, each with its own version.
Each pull request carries a changeset. On `main`, the release workflow opens a
Version Packages pull request that collects them, and merging it publishes
every package whose version changed. A package that depends on a changed one
gets its own bump from Changesets.

- Rejected: one version for every package. A catalog-only change would
  release every other package unchanged.
- Rejected: release-please. It takes each bump from a Conventional Commits
  message, so a badly worded commit gives a wrong bump.
- Rejected: hand-made tags, one per package. Nothing would release the
  packages that depend on a changed one.

`.changeset/config.json` sets:

- `access` to `public`: npm publishes a scoped package as restricted by
  default, and a restricted package needs a paid npm organization.
- `changelog` to `@changesets/changelog-github`: each changelog line links its
  pull request and thanks its author.

The release workflow builds and packs in a job without `id-token: write`, and
publishes in a separate job that runs no build script.

## Package manifests

- The root `test` script builds first: a package's `tsc` reads the `dist` of
  the packages it depends on.
- Each package's `test` runs `vitest run --passWithNoTests`: vitest fails a
  package with no test files, and a package has none until its first code.
- Each package holds its own copy of `LICENSE`: npm packs only the files
  inside the package's folder.
- `vitest` and `@vitest/coverage-v8` are pinned to the same exact version:
  `@vitest/coverage-v8` takes as a peer only the `vitest` version it was
  released with, so a caret on `vitest` lets the two drift apart.
